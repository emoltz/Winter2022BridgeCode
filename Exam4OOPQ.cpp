//A music streaming service would like us to create classes for use in their system. We need to track:
/*

* users
* songs
* advertisements
* release date
* users can earn points by listening to songs, so we need to track each person's "points"
* users can "unlock" songs with their points, so we need to track how many points a song has, and then deduct those points from the user
